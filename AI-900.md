# What is AI?

AI is the creation of software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities. Key workloads include:

- Machine learning
: This is often the foundation for an AI system, and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.
- Anomaly detection
: The capability to automatically detect errors or unusual activity in a system.
In Azure, the Anomaly Detector service provides an application programming interface (API) that developers can use to create anomaly detection solutions.
- Computer vision
: The capability of software to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.
- Natural language processing
: The capability for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.
- Knowledge mining
: The capability to extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.

## Computer vision capabilities
- Image classification 
: Image classification involves training a machine learning model to classify images based on their contents. For example, in a traffic monitoring solution you might use an image classification model to classify images based on the type of vehicle they contain, such as taxis, buses, cyclists, and so on.
- Object detection 
: Object detection machine learning models are trained to classify individual objects within an image, and identify their location with a bounding box. For example, a traffic monitoring solution might use object detection to identify the location of different classes of vehicle.
- Semantic segmentation 
: Semantic segmentation is an advanced machine learning technique in which individual pixels in the image are classified according to the object to which they belong. For example, a traffic monitoring solution might overlay traffic images with "mask" layers to highlight different vehicles using specific colors.
- Image analysis
: You can create solutions that combine machine learning models with advanced image analysis techniques to extract information from images, including "tags" that could help catalog the image or even descriptive captions that summarize the scene shown in the image.
- Face detection, analysis, and recognition
: Face detection is a specialized form of object detection that locates human faces in an image. This can be combined with classification and facial geometry analysis techniques to recognize individuals based on their facial features.
- OCR
: Optical chaacter recognition is a technique used to detect and read text in images. You can use OCR to read text in photographs (for example, road signs or store fronts) or to extract information from scanned documents such as letters, invoices, or forms.

## NLP
NLP enables you to create software that can:
- Analyze and interpret text in documents, email messages, and other sources.
- Interpret spoken language, and synthesize speech responses.
- Automatically translate spoken or written phrases between languages.
- Interpret commands and determine appropriate actions.

|Service|Capabilities|
